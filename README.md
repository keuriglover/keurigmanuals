How Keurig Works

A Keurig machine works by using a small amount of coffee grounds that are pressed into a pod. These grounds are mixed with hot water and the hot water is pushed through the pod to produce a coffee. There are many different flavors that can be used and Keurig pods are available in a variety of different sizes and shapes.
